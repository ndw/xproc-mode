;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a primitive XProc mode which is nothing more than a copy
;; of XML mode. Adds Org-Babel support for evaluating XProc pipelines.
;;
;; This is a primitive implementation created by hacking ob-ledger.

;;; Code:

(require 'nxml-mode)
(require 'ob)

;; Define a variant of nxml-mode so that we can associated org-babel
;; with it.
(define-derived-mode xproc-mode nxml-mode
  (nxml-mode))

;; Define a processor. This must be a shell script that will process
;; an XProc pipeline. See https://github.com/ndw/xmlcalabash2/
